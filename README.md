# Description of the project
An Audio Visualiser that depicts a car travelling slowly with pillars representing audio bands in the background

# Instructions for use
Run the .exe file in the build folder

# How it works
Creates pillars attached to a  cylinder that have their height constantly scaling based off of values taken from the spectrum data of the audio source. 
The pillars have colors procedurally assigned to ensure there is a small difference in colour from one pillar to the next.
The Cylinder rotates with the pillars rotating with it.
The wheels of the car rotate but the car does not move, instead the rotation of the cylinder makes it seem like the car is moving.
The Colour hue is altered to give the effect of constantly changing colours.

# References
The car was imported from this asset package:

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
The use of post processing and color grading to alter the colour of the scene. 
Initially I was constantly updating the colour of each pillar in every frame with a new colour but this was causing drops in frame rate.
Using post processing gave much better performance.


# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:
Initially I decided to do a maze game but decided against it in favour of an audio visualiser.
